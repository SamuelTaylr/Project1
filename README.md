# Project 1
Revature Big Data Project 1

# Project Description
Project Requirements: Sample-HIVE-Project This project is mainly for learning and practicing simple HIVE commands in real time scenarios. 
Here we have taken some sample coffee shop data and processed some essential queries to demonstrate HDFS & HIVE commands. Using Spark and Scala With Coffee shop data. 

Project was designed to quickly and efficiently run simple queries using spark sql and hive.  All of our group recieved the same queries but we were responsible with coming up with a unique individual query.  I chose to create new tables for price, total sales and profits and join them to the original tables.  Using that, I ran queries to see the profits and best selling items for each branch and graph the results in Zeppelin.

# Getting Started
Repo can be cloned easily using the Github Desktop app or by using Intellij IDEA's create project from remote repository.  Because project was built in IntelliJ it includes multiple IDEA files which will prevent the project from working as is on other IDE's.  It will also require you to download WinUtils and create a new WinUtils folder in your C drive, then point to that folder in the main method.  Currently it is pointing to the location on my system but this will need to be adjusted for your location.  It also requires IntelliJ IDEA and Java 8 to be installed.
